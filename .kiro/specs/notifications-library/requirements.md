# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The notifications library will provide a comprehensive notification system for ChainLink that enables multiple communication channels including push notifications, transactional emails, weekly summary emails, and Discord notifications for system events. This system will enhance user engagement by keeping players informed about game events, achievements, social interactions, and important updates across their preferred communication channels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a ChainLink player, I want to receive push notifications on my device, so that I can stay updated on game events and opportunities in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables push notifications THEN the system SHALL register their device for push notification delivery
2. WHEN a significant game event occurs (chain completion, friend activity, matchup results) THEN the system SHALL send a push notification to subscribed users
3. WHEN a user receives a push notification THEN they SHALL be able to tap it to navigate directly to the relevant section of the app
4. IF a user has disabled push notifications THEN the system SHALL NOT send push notifications to that user
5. WHEN push notifications fail to deliver THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a ChainLink player, I want to receive transactional emails for important account and game events, so that I have a reliable record of my activities and can take necessary actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes account registration THEN the system SHALL send a welcome email with account verification

3. WHEN a user receives friend requests or squad invitations THEN the system SHALL send notification emails with action links
4. WHEN a user's account has security-related events (password changes, login from new device) THEN the system SHALL send security notification emails
5. WHEN a campaign or tournament the user is participating in has important updates THEN the system SHALL send informational emails
6. IF email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a ChainLink player, I want to receive weekly summary emails of my performance and platform activity, so that I can track my progress and stay engaged with the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a week completes THEN the system SHALL generate and send weekly summary emails to active users
2. WHEN generating weekly summaries THEN the system SHALL include user's chain performance, leaderboard position, friend activities, and upcoming opportunities
3. WHEN a user has been inactive for a week THEN the system SHALL send a re-engagement email with highlights of what they missed
4. IF a user has opted out of weekly emails THEN the system SHALL NOT send weekly summaries to that user
5. WHEN weekly email generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt to regenerate the email

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a ChainLink community member, I want Discord notifications for community engagement and social events, so that I can stay connected with other players and participate in community activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player achieves a significant milestone (long chain, leaderboard position, achievement unlock) THEN the system SHALL send Discord notifications to celebrate the accomplishment
2. WHEN new tournaments or campaigns launch THEN the system SHALL send Discord notifications to announce opportunities for community participation
3. WHEN squad activities occur (new members, squad achievements, competitions) THEN the system SHALL send Discord notifications to relevant squad channels
4. IF Discord webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log failures
5. WHEN Discord notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include engaging content and links to encourage community interaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a ChainLink player, I want to manage my notification preferences across all channels, so that I can control what communications I receive and how I receive them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses notification settings THEN they SHALL see options to enable/disable each notification type for each channel
2. WHEN a user updates their notification preferences THEN the changes SHALL take effect immediately for future notifications
3. WHEN a user opts out of a notification type THEN the system SHALL respect that preference across all relevant scenarios
4. IF a user has no valid contact method for a critical notification THEN the system SHALL display an in-app notification as fallback
5. WHEN notification preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL log the change for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the notifications library, I want a unified API for sending notifications across all channels, so that I can easily trigger notifications without managing multiple service integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls the notification API THEN they SHALL be able to specify the notification type, recipient, and content in a single request

5. WHEN notifications are processed THEN the system SHALL return delivery status and tracking information to the caller

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a ChainLink administrator, I want comprehensive logging and analytics for all notification activities, so that I can monitor system performance and optimize user engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL log delivery attempts, successes, failures, and user interactions
2. WHEN analyzing notification performance THEN administrators SHALL be able to view delivery rates, open rates, and click-through rates by notification type and channel
3. WHEN troubleshooting notification issues THEN administrators SHALL be able to search logs by user, notification type, timestamp, and delivery status
4. IF notification volumes exceed normal thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert administrators of potential issues
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on user engagement patterns and notification effectiveness
