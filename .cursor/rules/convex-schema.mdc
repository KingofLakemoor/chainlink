- Refer to the example schema provided for guidance on structuring your Convex schema.
- Pay attention to index creation using `.index()` and field validation using `v`.
- Understand that Convex automatically generates system fields `_id` and `_creationTime` for every document.
- Do not manually add indices for `_id` and `_creationTime` as they are added automatically.
- When designing the schema, refer to the built-in System fields and data types available at https://docs.convex.dev/database/types.

- Pay special attention to the correct usage of the `v` validator builder (https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#v) for defining schema types.
